# Assignment 4 - N-Body Simulation (OpenMP)

## Overview

This folder contains the implementation for Assignment 4 of the ECE 759 - High-Performance Computing course. The assignment focuses on simulating the gravitational interactions between particles in an N-body system. The tasks include:
1. N-Body Simulation in Python: A sequential implementation that simulates particle interactions and visualizes the results.
2. Porting to C++: A C++ implementation of the N-body simulation, maintaining the same functionality as the Python version.
3. Parallelization with OpenMP: Optimization of the C++ implementation using OpenMP to parallelize computationally intensive sections.
4. Scheduling Policy Experiments: Analysis of performance under different OpenMP scheduling policies (static, dynamic, guided) with varying numbers of threads.
5. 
These implementations are benchmarked on the Euler computing cluster to evaluate the impact of parallelization and scheduling policies on performance.
