# Assignment 6 -  Matrix Multiplication and Parallel Reduction (CUDA)
## Overview
This folder contains the code and implementation for Assignment 7 of the ECE 759 - High-Performance Computing course. The assignment focuses on implementing and optimizing key computational algorithms using CUDA, analyzing their performance on large datasets, and leveraging shared memory for improved efficiency. The key tasks include:

- **Matrix Function**: A tiled implementation of matrix multiplication using CUDA, optimized with shared memory to improve memory access patterns.  
- **Parallel Reduction**: A reduction algorithm that sums up large arrays using CUDA's parallel processing, optimized with "First Add During Load" to minimize memory transactions.
