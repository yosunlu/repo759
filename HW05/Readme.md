# Assignment 5 - CUDA Programming Tasks

## Overview

This folder contains the implementation for Assignment 5 of the ECE 759 - High-Performance Computing course. The assignment involves using CUDA to parallelize computations and optimize performance on GPUs. The tasks include:
- **Factorial Calculation**: A CUDA kernel computes factorials of integers from 1 to 8 using parallel threads.
- **Array Computation**: A CUDA kernel performs computations on a device array using thread and block indices and copies the results back to the host.
- **Vector Scaling**: A CUDA kernel implements element-wise multiplication of two arrays, optimizing performance for large inputs.
These implementations are benchmarked on the Euler computing cluster to analyze their scalability and performance characteristics.
